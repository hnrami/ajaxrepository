I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an unfortunate incident regarding the damage to my laptop that occurred 1.5 years ago, which I believe requires immediate attention and resolution.

Approximately 1.5 years ago, the screen of my laptop was accidentally damaged. At that time, when we received the quotation from Dell for the repair, the cost was quoted at 12k. However, the latest quotation for the same repair now stands at a staggering 52k. This significant increase in repair cost over a relatively short period is alarming and unexpected.

I am deeply concerned about the decision not to repair the laptop when the cost was considerably lower. Delaying the repair has resulted in a fourfold increase in expenses, which is unacceptable given the circumstances. It's important to note that I am dedicated to my work, often putting in long hours from 9 to 12 each day. While accidents can happen, it was certainly not intentional, and I take full responsibility for the damage caused.

Unfortunately, the current repair cost far exceeds what I can afford on my salary alone. I do not have additional income sources to cover such an expense, and investments like stocks or cryptocurrency would not yield returns substantial enough to offset this financial burden.

I kindly request your urgent intervention and assistance in finding an equitable solution to this situation. It is imperative that we explore options that are reasonable and considerate of the circumstances. I am open to discussing potential compromises or alternative resolutions that would alleviate the financial strain caused by this incident.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and eagerly await your guidance on how best to proceed.
